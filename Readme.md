To ab tak humne kya kiya hai
ki project setup kiya
aur ab hum continuously api pe call marenge har 5 minute
data fetch karenge, aur in memory mein store karenge

data fetch ho rha hai continuously aur store ho rha hai db mein

iske baad, ye jo data api se aaya tha, iska use krke summaries banayenge daily
aur in summaries ko bhi db mein store kr denge

//summary route se summary mil rahi hai, city aur date dene pe

we are using AlertThresholds to create alerts, but we have never created thresholds, so we won't ever be able to create alert


Daily summary calculating accurately, just something about the date, its calculating for yesterday which is technically correct as we have all the weather records for last day and not the weather records for today's date, well, will see about it later
